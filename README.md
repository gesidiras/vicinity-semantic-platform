# Semantic discovery platform

The purpose of this component is to enable the semantic interoperability within the VICINITY.
Semantic discovery platform contains the repository of IoT object descriptions,
semantically enhanced using VICINITY ontology (output of Task T2.2).
Semantic platform is the only storage component, where IoT object descriptions
are available.

Semantic discovery platform consists of:
* [semantic storage](docs/STORAGE.md)
* [semantic (discovery, configuration) services](docs/SERVICES.md)
